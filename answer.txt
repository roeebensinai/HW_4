A.

We assume that a manual check will take the following time:
	1. Open an article (10 sec)
	2. Search for the relevant words (180 sec)
	3. Calculate and sum (10 sec)
Total time = 60*200 = 1200 sec = 3 hours + 20 min


B.

We conclude that using Bash Script can be extremely helpfull while searching / operating many actions on a big amount of file / data.
We can use sctripts while searchin for a specific information in a big data base.
Scripts can calculate many actions in a short period of time over a wide source of informotion.


C.

In order to repeat the action every hour, we can use the known function repeat, that can save us time and can do actions automaticlly by itself.
we only need to set the wanted period of time and the wanted action once.
In order to prevent unnecessary searches in articles that we've already searched through, we can add an if condition that checks if the specific URL has been visited before.
